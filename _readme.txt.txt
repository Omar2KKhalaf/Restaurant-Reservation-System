In the Project :
** In newClient.fxml  : when you finish signing up and press on sign up button it will automatically save it in customers.xml without returning to main window of sample.fxml
** In all fxml : we put some designing photos in their scenes but sometimes they dont appear when we send it to the other partner in the project 
                 , so it maybe not appear for you , however they exist
